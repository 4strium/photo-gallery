## Introduction
Here is the repository which contains all the code behind my static personal site, it is almost exclusively HTML/CSS but there is a little JavaScript for the [landing page swiper](https://swiperjs.com/).

In my free time I love photographing aircraft ([planespotting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_spotting)) but also all the remarkable events and places that I come across on my path! ðŸ™‚

So I decided to code the most personal way to share my photos without going through third party sites/social networks.

## Website architecture
My photos are organized into collections, allowing the user to view them in a thematic and organized way. This also allows me to have a simple template to follow when I add new collections.

I coded my site so that it is always functional regardless of the format and resolution of your screen: phone, computer, etc...

## Deployment
Currently, the site is deployed thanks to [Render](https://render.com/) service.
